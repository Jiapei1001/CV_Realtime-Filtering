# Computer Vision_Realtime-Filtering
Realtime Filtering for images or video streams

## Summary
This project explores several types of filtering methods. These filters can be applied to cv::Mat which is rendered as an image or a frame for a video. The filter rendering happens in realtime.Â 

Some of the high level steps are: opening, capturing, manipulating, and writing images. User can always get the latest result after a selected filtering type. User can type different keys for a selection of filters. In addition to these filters, user can also type 's' to save the rendered image, or type 'q' to exit.

This project is built on top of OpenCV open-source library. It explores some modules including core functionality, image processing, etc.
